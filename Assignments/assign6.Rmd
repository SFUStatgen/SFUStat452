There will be an in-class canvas quiz on these questions on 
Thursday Nov. 28.

The questions in this assignment use the 
`USArrests` data. You will need two copies of 
the data, one that is centred only and 
one that is both centred and scaled.

```{r}
USArrests <- scale(USArrests,scale=FALSE)
USArrests.sc <- scale(USArrests,scale=TRUE)
```

## Question 1 (Chapter 10, #8)

For this question, use `USArrests.sc`.

## Question 2 (Chapter 10, #9)

b) Print the names of the states in each of the three
clusters.

when there are three clusters and compare these
to the three clusters from part (b).
