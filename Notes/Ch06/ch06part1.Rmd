# Introduction


## Alternatives to Least Squares

* We have used least squares to fit the linear model

\begin{equation}
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \ldots + \beta_p X_p + \epsilon.
\label{eqn:linMod}
\end{equation}

* In this chapter we consider alternative
methods of 
fitting the model, with the goal of 
better prediction accuracy and model interpretability 
when $p$ is large.
    + Prediction accuracy: Unless $n$ is much larger
    than $p$ there is a tendancy to overfit, leading
    to poor predictions on the test set. In case
    $p>n$ there is no unique least squares solution.
    + Model interpretability: It is often the case
    that only a small subset
    of the predictors is truly associated with 
    the response. The model is more interpretable
    without irrelevant variables.

## Approaches in this Chapter

* Each of the following can be thought of as a strategy
to reduce variance, with (hopefully) minimal
increase in bias.
* Subset selection: Forward, backward, stepwise
and all subsets
selection to identify truly associated model terms.
* Shrinkage (regularization): Shrink estimated coefficients
toward zero. 
* Dimension reduction: Find a low-dimension representation
of the predictors, and use these as predictors.

# Subset Selection

## Best (All) Subset Selection

* Straightforward idea: Consider
all $2^p$ possible models ($p$ with one predictor,
${p \choose 2} = p(p-1)/2$ with two predictors, etc.) and 
choose the one with the best estimated test set error.
    + Can use cross validation to 
    estimate test set error, or
    computationally cheaper alternatives ($C_p$,
    BIC -- to be discussed).
* Break the exhaustive search for the best of all
models into two steps:
    (a) Fit all ${p \choose k}$ models with 
    $k$ predictors and select the one, call
    it $\mathcal{M}_k$, with the smallest RSS.
    (b) Select the best model from
    $\mathcal{M}_0,\ldots,\mathcal{M}_p$ 
    based on estimated test set error.
* See Algorithm 6.1 in text for a complete algorithm.

## Drawback of All Subsets

* Computational: $2^p$ becomes very large as
$p$ increases. 

\scriptsize

```{r}
p<-10; 2^p
p<-20; 2^p
```

## Example of All Subsets

\scriptsize

```{r}
uu <- url("http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/Credit.csv")
Credit <- read.csv(uu,row.names=1) 
head(Credit,n=3)
library(leaps) # contains regsubsets()
cfits <- regsubsets(Balance ~ ., data=Credit,nvmax=11)
cfits.sum <- summary(cfits)
```

##

\tiny

```{r}
cfits.sum$which
```

## 

\scriptsize

```{r}
cfits.sum$rss
cfits.sum$rsq
cfits.sum$cp
```

##

\scriptsize

```{r,fig.height=6,fig.width=8}
plot(cfits,scale="Cp")
```

## RSS and $R^2$ for Model Selection

* RSS always decreases when we add predictors,
even if the added predictors are, in fact, unrelated
to the response.
    + $k$ predictors: Least squares finds the 
    coefficients $\hat{\beta}_0,\ldots,\hat{\beta}_k$
    that minimize RSS.
    + $k+1$ predictors: Least squares can 
    reduce RSS compared to 
    coefficients $\hat{\beta}_0,\ldots,\hat{\beta}_k,
    0$.
* Similarly, $R^2 = 1-RSS/TSS$ always increases.
* Neither is useful for comparing models of different
size.
    + Will define $C_p$ and other measures soon.

## Forward Selection

* Select the best model of each size through the 
following restricted search:
    + Start with the null model, $\mathcal{M}_0$,
    that contains no predictors.
    + Consider the best model, $\mathcal{M}_1$ with 
    1 predictor.
    + Consider the best model, $\mathcal{M}_2$ obtained
    by adding one of the $p-1$ terms **not** in
    $\mathcal{M}_1$.
    + Consider the best model, $\mathcal{M}_3$ obtained
    by adding one of the $p-2$ terms **not** in 
    $\mathcal{M}_2$.
    + And so on.
* Then use the estimated test set error to select the
best from $\mathcal{M}_0,\ldots,\mathcal{M}_p$.
* See Algorithm 6.2.

## Example Forward Selection

\scriptsize

```{r,fig.height=6,fig.width=8}
cfits.fwd <- regsubsets(Balance ~ .,data=Credit,
                        method="forward")
plot(cfits.fwd,scale="Cp")
```

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Forward Selection

* Advantages:
    + Far less computation. Can show forward selection
    only fits $1 + p(p+1)/2$ models. With 
    $p=20$, $2^p=1048686$ while $1+p(p+1)/2 = 211.
    + Can be applied even when $p>n$.
* Disadvantage:
    + Not guaranteed to find the best model.

## Backward Selection

* Reverse of forward selection: Start with the 
largest model and remove the least predictive predictor
one at a time.
    + Start with the full model $\mathcal{M}_p$.
    + Consider the best model, $\mathcal{M}_{p-1}$,
    obtained by removing one of the $p$ terms
    in $\mathcal{M}_p$.
    + Consider the best model, $\mathcal{M}_{p-2}$ obtained
    by removing one of the $p-1$ terms in
    $\mathcal{M}_{p-1}$.
    + And so on.
* Then use the estimated test set error to select the
best from $\mathcal{M}_0,\ldots,\mathcal{M}_p$.
* See Algorithm 6.3.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Backward Selection

* Advantage:
    + Same computation as forward selection.
    Only fits $1 + p(p+1)/2$ models.
* Disadvantage:
    + Not guaranteed to find the best model.

## Hybrid Stepwise Selection

* Iterate between adding and deleting model
terms in the search for a best model.

\scriptsize

```{r,fig.height=5,fig.width=7}
cfit.hybrid <- regsubsets(Balance ~ ., data=Credit,
                          method="seqrep")
plot(cfit.hybrid,scale="Cp")
```

## Model Comparisons and Estimated Test Error

* Estimated test error is a basis for 
model comparison.
* Methods for estimating test error are classified
as indirect or direct.
* Indirect methods estimate the "optimism", which is
roughly the difference between the test and training
errors.
    + That is, test error = training error + optimism   
    and estimated test error = training error + estimated optimism
* Direct methods use validation or cross-validation.

## Indirect methods

* $C_p$, AIC and BIC are in this class.
* $C_p$ for a model with $d$ (subset of $p$)
predictors is defined as 
$$C_p = \frac{1}{n}({\rm RSS} + 2d\hat{\sigma}^2)$$
or (Mallow's definition)
$$C'_p = \frac{\rm RSS}{\hat{\sigma^2}} + 2d - n$$
where $\hat{\sigma}^2$ is an estimate of $\sigma^2$
from a low-bias model.
* Ignoring scalings and constants that are the 
same for all models being compared, $C_p$ is essentially
RSS plus a penalty that increases with $d$.

## AIC

* AIC stands for Akaike Information Criterion.
* AIC can be defined for many models fit by maximum 
likelihood.
* For linear regression with Gaussian errors
AIC is essentially $C'_p$ up to scale and constant factors.
    + A difference is that $\hat{\sigma}^2$ 
    in AIC is usually taken to be the estimate
    from the current model, rather than a 
    fixed low-bias model.
    + For model selection with models fit by least squares,
    we usually report $C_p$ (or $C'_p$).

## BIC

* BIC stands for Bayesian Information Criterion and
is a.k.a Schwartz's criterion.
* BIC is defined in the text as
$${\rm BIC} = \frac{1}{n}({\rm RSS} + \log_e(n) d\hat{\sigma}^2)$$
to highlight similarities with their definition of $C_p$.
    + For BIC, replace the factor 2 by $\log(n)$ in the 
    penalty term of $C_p$.
    + What matters is that BIC is essentially RSS plus
    a penalty that depends on $d$ and grows 
    faster with $d$ because of the $\log(n)$.
    + $\log_e(n) > 2$ for $N>7$.
    
## Aside: AIC and BIC in R

* R uses the formulas $AIC = - 2 \ell(\hat{\beta},\hat{\sigma}^2) + 2 p$ and $BIC = - 2 \ell(\hat{\beta},\hat{\sigma}^2) + \log_e(n) p$,
where $\ell$ is the log-likelihood. 
    + The likelihood is the probability of 
the data, considered as a function of the parameters.
    + $p$ is the number of model parameters that have
been estimated, **including** $\sigma^2$.

\scriptsize

```{r}
set.seed(1); x <- 1:100; y <- x + rnorm(100)
ff <- lm(y~x)
logLik(ff)
AIC(ff) # -2*logLik(ff) + 2*3
BIC(ff) # -2*logLik(ff) + log(100)*3
```

## Direct Methods

* Can use validation or cross-validation to 
directly estimate the test error.
    + Takes a little programming -- see week 6 exercises.
