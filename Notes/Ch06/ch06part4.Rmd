## High-Dimensional Data

* The "dimension" of the regression/prediction problem is the 
number of predictors, $p$, not the sample size, $n$.
* Low-dimensional: Traditional statistical inference was designed for 
$n \gg p$.
* When $n \approx p$, these methods are subject to over-fitting,
or may fail.
* High-dimensional: Data collection technologies are allowing more
predictors to be measured on observational units, but the number
of units is still limited, leading to $p \gg n$.
* High-dimensional data example: Genome-wide association studies.
    + It is now possible to type about 1 million single nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome, but study sizes are still
    in the 1000's. $p \approx 1,000,000 \gg n \approx 2000$.
    

## What Goes Wrong When $p$ Large?

* In a word: overfitting. 
* Replicate the experiment summarized in Figure 6.23 of the text.
    + Illustrates the importance of using test set error
    to evaluate model performance
* A response $Y$ on $n=20$ subjects, completely unrelated to predictors
$X_1,\ldots,X_{20}$.

##  High-Dimensional Regression ($p \gg n$)

* When $p>n$ least squares has no unique solution.
* Other methods, such as forward selection, Lasso and PCR are useful.
* These approaches avoid overfitting by being less flexible than 
least squares.
* However, they also perform poorly if most of the predictors are
noise.

\small

* Text, Fig. 6.24:
Lasso with $n=100$ and 20 predictors associated with response. 
Boxplots show test MSE for three values of tuning
$\lambda$ that lead to different numbers of non-zero coefficients (df).
    + When $p=20$, no regularization (incl. all 21 terms) is best.
    + When $p=50$, use a moderate amount of regularization.
    + When $p=2000$ even the lasso is overwhelmed by the noise, and 
    no amount of regularization works.
    
## Curse of Dimensionality

* Notice that the test set error actually increases as the 
proportion of noise predictors increases.
* Conclusion:
Adding noise predictors leads to a deterioration in the fitted model.

## Collinearity in High Dimensions

* Collinearity becomes severe in high dimensions.
    + Just as combinations of noise predictor variables can predict $y$, 
    so can they predict other predictors.
    + E.G., 19 noise predictors explain about 60% 
    of the variation in the 20th in our simulated data example

\scriptsize

```{r}
fit <- lm.fit(X[,1:19],X[,20])
TSS20 <- sum((X[,20]-mean(X[,20]))^2)
R2(fit,TSS20)
```

\normalsize

* When there are many predictors, a selected set is one of many
that predicts the resonse.
