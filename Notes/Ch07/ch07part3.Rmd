# Smoothing Splines

## Smoothing Splines Overview

* Smoothing splines are an alternative approach to devising a 
smooth curve.
* Though the derivation is different, we end up with a 
natural cubic spline, with knots *at each observed
data point*. 
    + The estimated coefficients of the basis functions using 
    least squares would interpolate the data points.
    + To avoid over-fitting, a shrinkage penalty is added to the 
    RSS. The penalty is comprised of a tuning parameter 
    times a penalty term.
    
## Smoothness

* We seek a *smooth* function $g(x)$ that fits the data well. 
    + Want $RSS = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - g(x_i))^2$ small.
* By smooth we mean not too "rough" (wiggly)
    + If RSS is the objective function, the curve $g$ will interpolate 
    the data and will be very rough.
    + Illustrate by fitting a natural cubic spline to simulated
    data on "age" and "wage"
    
\scriptsize

```{r}
set.seed(1)
age <- scale(18:80); betas <- c(2,-2,2,-2)
f <- poly(age,degree=4)%*% betas 
wage <- f + rnorm(length(age))
sfit0 <- smooth.spline(age,wage,lambda=0)
newage<-seq(from=min(age),to=max(age),length=1000)
pwage0 <- predict(sfit0,newage)
```

##

\scriptsize

```{r}
plot(age,wage)
lines(pwage0$x,pwage0$y,col="blue") # fitted curve
lines(age,f,col="red") # true curve
```

## Penalized Objective Function

* The criterion function to minimimize is 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}(y_i - g(x_i))^2 + \lambda \int g''(t)^2 dt.
\label{eqn:crit}
\end{equation}
* Like ridge regression or the lasso, the objective function 
is of the form RSS + penalty, and we have a tuning,
or smoothing parameter
$\lambda$, but the penalty function is now
$\int g''(t) dt$.
    + $g''(t)$ is the curvature of $g$ at $t$.
    + $\int g''(t)^2 dt$ is a measure of the 
    total curvature.
* It can be shown that the minimizer of (\ref{eqn:crit})
is a natural cubic spline with knots at the unique observed
data points, with 
the coefficients of the basis functions _shrunken_ towards
zero.
    + The degree of shrinkage is controlled by $\lambda$.

\scriptsize

```{r}
sfit1 <- smooth.spline(age,wage,spar=1) #spar= c1+c2*log(lambda)
pwage1 <- predict(sfit1,newage)
plot(age,wage)
lines(pwage0$x,pwage0$y,col="blue") # fitted curve with lambda=0
lines(pwage1$x,pwage1$y,col="green")
lines(age,f,col="red") # true curve
```

## Choosing the Smoothing Parameter

* Could use cross validation to select $\lambda$.
    + How many folds?
* It turns out there is a very simple formula for the CV 
estimate of test error when using leave-out-one CV (LOOCV):
\begin{equation}
CV_{(n)} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{g}_{\lambda}(x_i)^{(-i)})^2 =
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \frac{y_i - \hat{g}_{\lambda}(x_i)}{1-\{S_{\lambda}\}_{ii}}\right)^2
\label{eqn:CVsmooth}
\end{equation}
where 
    + $\hat{g}_{\lambda}(x_i)^{(-i)}$ is the fitted value
    for $x_i$ when $(x_i,y_i)$ is held out of the training set,
    + $\hat{g}_{\lambda}(x_i)$ is the fitted value for $x_i$ 
    when all of the data are used to fit $g$,
    + $\{S_{\lambda}\}_{ii}$ is the $i$th diagonal entry of the "smoother matrix".
    
## The Smoother Matrix

* The smoother matrix $S_{\lambda}$ is the matrix that 
turns the response $y$ into the smooth $\hat{g}_{\lambda}$; i.e.,
$\hat{g}_{\lambda}(x) = S_{\lambda} y$, where
$x$ is the vector of explanatory variable values and 
$\hat{g}_{\lambda}(x)$ is the vector of $\hat{g}_{\lambda}(x_i)$ values.
* In linear regression, the smoother matrix is called the 
hat matrix and is denoted $H$. 
    + $H$ turns the response $y$ into $\hat{y}$; i.e.,
    $\hat{y} = H y$,
    + The sum of the diagonal elements of $H$ is the 
    number of regression coefficients $p+1$.
    + The diagonal elements are the hat values, or leverages $h_i$.
* Thus the $CV_{(n)}$ estimate for the smoothing spline is analogous
to least squares, with the diagonal elements of $H$ replaced
by those of $S_{\lambda}$.

## Effective Degrees of Freedom

* In linear regression, the model df $p+1$ can be shown 
to equal the sum of the diagonal elements of $H$.
* By analogy, the sum of the diagonal elements
of the smoother matrix is refered to as the 
_effective degrees of freedom_ and is denoted $df_{\lambda}$.
    + One can show that as $\lambda$ ranges from 0 to $\infty$,
    $df_{\lambda}$ ranges from $n$ to 2.
    + Can treat $df_{\lambda}$ as the smoothing parameter and
    select its value by CV.

\scriptsize

```{r}
sfitCV <- smooth.spline(age,wage,cv=TRUE)
sfitCV$df
pwageCV <- predict(sfitCV,newage)
plot(age,wage)
lines(pwageCV$x,pwageCV$y,col="green")
lines(age,f,col="red") # true curve
```


## Example

\scriptsize

```{r}
library(ISLR); data(Wage)
plot(Wage$age,Wage$wage,pch=".")
sfit <- smooth.spline(Wage$age,Wage$wage,cv=TRUE)
pwage <- predict(sfit)
lines(sfit,col="green") # can plot output of smooth.spline directly
```

# Local Regression

## Local Regression

* A variation on KNN: instead of fitting a constant over 
a neighborhood, fit a weighted regression.
    + weighted means points in the neighborhood closest to the 
    point of prediction are up-weighted.
    + the regression could be constant, linear or quadratic.
* The neighborhood size is refered to as the "span" $s$.

## Local Linear Regression Algorithm

* Select a span $s$ and a weight function $K(x_i,x_0)$.
* For $X=x_0$:
    1. Extract the nearest $s*n$ points to $x_0$ to train the 
    local regression.
    2. Assign weight $K_{0i} = K(x_i,x_0)$ to each neighbor.
    3. Fit a weighted least-squares regression; that is, find
    the $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$ that minimize
    $$\sum_{i=1}^n K(x_i,x_0)(y_i - [\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i])^2$$
    4. $\hat{f}(x_0) = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_0$.

\scriptsize

```{r}
plotfit <- function(fit,dat,newdat){
  preds <- data.frame(newdat,
          predict(fit,newdata=newdat,se=TRUE))
  preds <- mutate(preds, # approx. CIs from the SEs
                  lwr = preds$fit-2*preds$se,upr = preds$fit+2*preds$se)
  ggplot(dat,aes(x=age,y=wage)) + geom_point(alpha=0.1) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(x=age,y=fit,ymin=lwr,ymax=upr),
                data=preds,fill="blue",alpha=.2) + 
    geom_line(aes(y=fit),data=preds,color="blue")
}
```

##

\scriptsize

```{r}
library(ggplot2); library(dplyr)
newdat <- data.frame(age=seq(from=min(Wage$age),to=max(Wage$age),length=100))
fit2 <- loess(wage~age,span=0.2,data=Wage)
plotfit(fit2,Wage,newdat)
```

##

\scriptsize

```{r}
fit5 <- loess(wage~age,span=0.5,data=Wage)
plotfit(fit5,Wage,newdat)
```

## Extensions to Higher Dimension

* For $p>1$ explanatory variables,  we can generalize local regression.
    + Choose neighborhoods based on $X_1,\ldots,X_p$.
    + Fit a multiple linear regression.
* However, it has been observed that local regression performs
poorly for $p>3$ because there are few points close to $x_0$
(recall homework 2).
