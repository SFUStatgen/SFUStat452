## Introduction to Boosting

* Reference: Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman (2001). The 
Elements of Statistical Learning (hereafter ESL).

* Motivation for boosting: Combine many "weak" classifiers to 
produce a powerful "committee".
    + Similar in this respect to bagging, but otherwise
    fundamentally different.
* A weak classifier is one that does little better than
guessing.
    + On its own a weak classifier is not useful, but 
    if applied _sequentially_, it can produce a powerful classifier.

## Example Boosting Algorithm: AdaBoost.M1

* Due to Freund and Schapire (1997).
* Suppose two outcome classes $Y=-1$ or 1
and a "base" classifier that produces 
a prediction.
    + Need not be a decision tree classifier at this point.
* Sequentially apply the classifier to modified versions 
of the data (more on next slide), leading to a sequence of weak 
classifiers $G_m(x)$; $m=1,\ldots,M$ which are weighted
to give final predictions.

## AdaBoost Weighting

* Combine predictions with a weighted majority 
vote 
$$G(x) = {\rm sign} \left( \sum_{m=1}^M \alpha_m G_m(x) \right),$$
which classifies as $1$ if weighted sum $>0$ and $-1$ otherwise.
    + The classifier weights $\alpha_m$ are computed by the algorithm to
    give higher weight to more accurate classifiers.
* Modify the data at each boosting step 
by applying observation weights $w_1,\ldots,w_n$.
    + Initially all weights are equal.
    + At step $m$, observations that were misclassified at
    step $m-1$ are up-weighted. 
    + As we go, observations that are difficult to classify 
    receive more and more weight, forcing the weak 
    classifier to focus on them.

## AdaBoost as an Additive Model

* Let $b(x;\gamma)$ be the base classifier for parameters $\gamma$.
    + Let $\gamma_m$ denote the values at step $m$, so that
    $G_m(x) = b(x;\gamma_m)$ is the classifier at
    step $m$. This is a basis function.
* The classifier weights are the coefficients of the basis functions.
* The additive model is 
$$f(x;\alpha,\gamma) = \sum_{m=1}^M \alpha_m b(x;\gamma_m)$$
* We would like to find the coefficients
$\alpha=(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_M)$
and $\gamma = (\gamma_1,\ldots,\gamma_M)$
that minimize a loss function, 
$$\sum_{i=1}^n L(y_i,f(x_i;\alpha)).$$
* We are used to the squared-error loss $L(y,f(x)) = (y-f(x))^2$ and misclassification $L(y,f(x)) = I(y\not= f(x))$; it turns out (ESL, Section 10.4) that
AdaBoost uses exponential loss function $L(y,f(x)) = \exp(-y f(x))$.

## Forward Stagewise Additive Modelling

* Finding the best values of $\alpha,\gamma$
is a difficult problem.
* Approximate the solution by a greedy algorithm that 
sequentially adds the best new basis function, without
adjusting the coefficients of those previously added.
    1. Initialize f_0(x) = 0$.
    2. For $m=1:M$
        (a) Find the $\alpha_m$ and $\gamma_m$ that minimize
        $\sum_{i=1}^n L(y_i,f_{m-1}(x_i)+\alpha b(x_i;\gamma))$
        (b) Set $f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x) + \alpha_m b(x;\gamma_m)$
    3. Return $\hat{f}(x) = f_M(x)$.


## Boosting Decision Trees

* The parameters of a decision tree are 
the disjoint regions (obtained by recursive partitioning)
and the values assigned to each region.
* Let $T(x;\gamma)$ be a tree.
* The boosted tree model is a sum
$$f_M(x) = \sum_{m=1}^M T(x;\gamma_m)$$
(**no weighting**), where the trees at step $m$ are 
fit according to the forward stagewise algorithm.
* At step $m$ we find the $\gamma_m$ that minimizes
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^n L(y_i,f_{m-1}(x_i)+ T(x_i;\gamma))
\label{eqn:boostCrit}
\end{equation}
and take $f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x) + T(x;\gamma_m)$.
    
## Boosting Regression Trees

* If a regression tree and the loss is squared-error loss, 
\begin{eqnarray*}
L(y_i,f_{m-1}(x_i)+T(x_i;\gamma)) & = &
(y_i-f_{m-1}(x_i)-T(x_i;\gamma))^2 \\
 & = &
(r_i^{(m-1)}-T(x_i;\gamma))^2,
\end{eqnarray*}
where $r_i^{(m-1)}$ is the $i$th residual
from step $m-1$.
* Solve (\ref{eqn:boostCrit}) by fitting a tree to
the residuals (Our text, Alg. 8.2).
* Note: As a basis function, $T(x;\gamma)$ could,
in general, depend on all predictors, which
would make the boosted model not additive in 
the sense of Chapter 7.
    + When the trees have only two leaves (i.e., one
    split on one variable), the boosted model is additive
    in the sense of Chapter 7.

## Gradient Boosting

* With loss functions other than squared-error and exponential,
the solution to (\ref{eqn:boostCrit}) is more challenging.
* A general, but approximate algorithm based on 
ideas from optimization is called gradient boosting.
    + A description is beyond the scope of this course.
    + We use the implementation in the `gbm` package.
    + A more modern implementation of boosting trees is
    in the package `xgboost` (eXtreme Gradient Boosting).
    More flexible, computations highly optimized and parallelized,
    but same basic idea.
    
## Choosing the Depth of the Trees

* Set the tree depth to be the same for all 
trees.
* Could consider the depth as a tuning parameter and 
choose it by cross-validation.
* Text and software suggest $d=1$ is often fine.
    + Software calls $d$ the interaction depth.
    For $d>1$ each tree depends on more than 
    one variable and would represent an "interaction".
    

## Shrinkage

* Large $M$ will lead to overfitting. 
* Can select $M$ as a tuning parameter, but 
experience has shown that it is better to 
take a large $M$ and shrink the contributions of each
tree by a factor $\lambda$; that is,
take $f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x) + \lambda T(x;\gamma_m)$.
