## Decision Trees

* Basic idea: Recursively split the space of predictors
into regions.
    + The prediction for a region is a summary of the 
    training responses in that region, such as the mean
    (regression) or mode (classification).
    + Represent the splits on different predictors
    as a tree $\Rightarrow$ decision trees.
* Single trees are not typically competitive for 
prediction accuracy, but we can produce multiple
decision trees and use the consensus from these 
as the prediction.
* Decision trees can be used for regression or
classification.

## Regression Trees

* Example: `Hitters` data

\scriptsize

```{r}
library(ISLR)
data(Hitters)
head(Hitters,n=3)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
Hitters <- mutate(Hitters,lSalary = log(Salary)) %>% na.omit()
```

## 

\scriptsize

```{r}
library(tree)
t1 <- tree(lSalary ~ Years + Hits,data=Hitters)
plot(t1)
text(t1)
```

##

\scriptsize

```{r}
t1.pr <- prune.tree(t1,best=3)
plot(t1.pr)
text(t1.pr)
```

## Tree Splits

* Tree represents a series of splits
    + First split on `Years`: Players with $<4.5$ go in
    left child branch, those with $\geq 4.5$ go in 
    right child branch.
    + Second split is on `Hits` for the branch with 
    `Years` $\geq 4.5$: Players with $<117.5$ go
    in left child branch, those with $\geq 117.5$ go 
    in right child branch.
* The resulting regions are called _terminal nodes_ or
_leaves_ of the tree.

* Text, Fig. 8.2:
Three regions from partitioning 
on (i) `Years` and then (ii) `Hits` within
`Years` $\geq 4.5$.


## Predictions for each Region

* The predictions are the mean log-Salary for 
players within each region; e.g.,

\scriptsize

```{r}
with(Hitters,mean(lSalary[Years<4.5])) # R1
with(Hitters,mean(lSalary[Years>=4.5&Hits<117.5])) #R2
with(Hitters,mean(lSalary[Years>=4.5&Hits>=117.5])) #R3
```

## Interpretation

\scriptsize

```{r}
plot(t1.pr); text(t1.pr)
```

\normalsize

* Years is most important, with newer players 
earning the lowest salaries.
* Within more experienced players, those who get more
hits get more \$.

## Stratification of the Feature Space

1. Divide the predictor space, or possible 
values of $X = (X_1,\ldots,X_p)$ into 
$J$ distinct non-overlapping regions,
$R_1,\ldots,R_J$.
2. For every observation in $R_j$, the prediction is
the mean response of observations in $R_j$.

## Stratification Into "Boxes"

* Restrict the regions to be "boxes" (high-dimensional
rectangles).
* Goal: Find the boxes $R_1,\ldots,R_J$ that are most
homogeneous with respect to the outcome; that is,
that minimize the RSS
$$\sum_{j=1}^J \sum_{i: x_i \in R_j} (y_i - \hat{y}_{R_j})^2,$$
where $\hat{y}_{R_j}$ is the mean outcome in box $R_j$.
* Rather than search all possible boxes, create them
by recursive splitting.
    + Start with the entire feature space.
    + Consider splitting on each variable and at 
    each data observed value.
    + Find the split that creates the two most 
    homogeneous regions.
    + Repeat.
    + Stop when, say, no leaf has more than a pre-specified
    number of observations.

## Tree Pruning

* Such a partition may predict the training 
observations well, but may overfit and yield 
poor predictions on test data.
* We could stop the splitting when the decrease 
in the RSS becomes "small".
* But stopping may miss good splits lower in the 
tree that reduce RSS.
* Strategy is to grow a big tree, $T_0$, and then "prune" it;
i.e., successively remove branches.

## Illustration of Pruning

\scriptsize

```{r}
t1.pr2 <- prune.tree(t1,best=4)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(t1.pr2); text(t1.pr2,cex=.5)
plot(t1.pr); text(t1.pr,cex=.5)
```

\normalsize

* Starting with the left-hand tree, the split at 
3.5 on `Year` is removed, or pruned off. 
* The remaining tree, on the right, is called a subtree.

## Criterion for Finding the Best Subtree

* Could consider removing all possible branches,
and evaluating the resulting subtree by CV-estimated
test set error.
    + Too computationally expensive.
    + An alternative is _cost complexity pruning_
* For a given value of a tuning parameter
$\alpha$, we seek the subtree $T$ that minimizes
$$\sum_{j=1}^{|T|} \sum_{i: x_i \in R_j} (y_i - \hat{y}_{R_j})^2 + \alpha|T|,$$
where $|T|$ is the number of leaves in tree $T$.

## Sequence of $\alpha$ Values

* When $\alpha=0$ the best subtree is $T_0$ itself.
* As $\alpha$ increases, we start to pay for 
extra nodes, and at some $\alpha_1$,
the best subtree $T_1$ will be a strict subtree 
with one branch removed.
* Weakest link cutting is 
an algorithm for finding the $\alpha_1$ that 
will yield a new optimal tree and finding 
this new optimal tree.
    + New tree: Collapse the internal node that produces the 
    smallest increase in RSS.
* We end up with a sequence of $\alpha$-values
$\alpha_0=0,\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k$ for some $k$,
and corresponding best trees 
$T_0 \supset T_1 \supset \ldots \supset T_k$.

## Choosing $\alpha$ and its Best Tree

* Now use CV to select the best value of 
$\alpha$.

## Estimated MSE

* Split Hitters into 132 training and
131 test obs'ns.
* Apply CV to the training half to select $\alpha$,
or equivalently $|T|$.

or CV (green). (No details on SEs.) Based on CV take $|T|=3$.


## Classification Trees

* Same idea as regression trees, but for predicting 
a qualitatitve response.
* Prediction for a region is the most
common class in the region.
* Regions are chosen to minimize a measure
of heterogeneity within the region.
    + Instead of RSS, use classification error rate
    as measure of heterogeneity?
    
    
## Leaf Heterogeneity Measures
  
* Classification error is not sensitive
enough for tree growing.
* Instead prefer the Gini index (sum of variances;
small when all $\hat{p}$'s near 0 or 1)
$$G_m = \sum_{k=1}^K \hat{p}_{mk} (1-\hat{p}_{mk})$$
or the cross-entropy (also small when all $\hat{p}$'s
near 0 or 1)
$$D_m = \sum_{k=1}^K \hat{p}_{mk} \log \hat{p}_{mk},$$
where $\hat{p}_{mk}$ is the proportion of 
observations in region $m$ that are from class $k$
and $K$ is the number of classes of the response.
    + $G_m$ and $D_m$ are near zero when 
    all but one $\hat{p}_{mk}$ near zero.

## Example: Heart Data

```{r}
uu <- url("http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/Heart.csv")
Heart <- read.csv(uu,row.names=1)
head(Heart,n=3)
```

* Binary outcome HD (heart disease Yes or No)

## Trees Versus Linear Models

* Which is better?
* Depends on the data-generating model. 
    + If approximately linear, or approximately constant
    over regions.
* Interpretability: Statisticians think of 
linear models as interpretable, but for many
decision trees are more natural.
* Trees are generally not as accurate at making
predictions, though.
* Can improve predictive ability by aggregating
many decision trees.
